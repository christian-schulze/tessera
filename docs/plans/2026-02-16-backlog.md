# Tessera Backlog

This document tracks future features and enhancements. Add new ideas here as they come up.

## Layout + Overflow

- Add a user-defined hook (configurable/scriptable) to decide what happens when tiling space runs out (e.g., float the new window, switch layout, or prompt).
- Make the layout retry window configurable via config/IPC (e.g., max attempts or total retry duration).
- Generate a default config file containing all defaults (good starting point for customization).

## Command System

- Fix Looking Glass return value for non-IPC `globalThis.__tessera.execute` in nested sessions (currently returns `undefined`).

## Visual Focus

- Render a focused-window border using GNOME Shell actor styling (frame-only) with configurable color and width (config/IPC). Suggested keys: `focusedBorderColor`, `focusedBorderWidth`.

## Layout Gaps

- Allow configurable gaps around/between each window (inner/outer gaps), configurable via config/IPC.

## Interaction

- Allow dragging tiles to swap locations.
- Fix split and layout toggle bindings not working correctly (likely related to alternating layout).
- Add GNOME top-panel icon with dropdown; include "Open logs" action that opens `~/.local/state/tessera/tessera.log`.
