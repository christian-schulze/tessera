# Tessera Backlog

This document tracks future features and enhancements. Add new ideas here as they come up.

## Layout + Overflow

- Add a user-defined hook (configurable/scriptable) to decide what happens when tiling space runs out (e.g., float the new window, switch layout, or prompt).
- Make the layout retry window configurable via config/IPC (e.g., max attempts or total retry duration).
- Generate a default config file containing all defaults (good starting point for customization).

## Command System

- Fix Looking Glass return value for non-IPC `globalThis.__tessera.execute` in nested sessions (currently returns `undefined`).
